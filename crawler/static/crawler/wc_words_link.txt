How long does the mixing process take? Due to the fact that our reserve is large and holds over 8.2 million dollars currently, you will not have to wait for someone else to send their coins to have your coins mixed. The mixing is often done instantly and the coins are sent back as soon as your coins come in. Ensure you send a decent amount in network fee along with the transaction to avoid coins not being sent any further due to miner rewards being low.

We provide our clients with the ability to mix their coins and attain safety in the process. Once the coins are sent to us, it is jumbled along with a series of other transactions through our mixer. Combining this with the countless transactions we have handled in the past makes it virtually impossible to pinpoint the source and endpoint of the coins. Due to the size of our reserve, we are also able to process transactions almost immediately leaving you with no concern of timely delivery of the coin. Can I trust you with my money? We take protective measures against errors and malicious acts. For every incoming order, we provide a PGP-signed letter of guarantee that confirms the designated obligations What logs do you keep? Logs of any nature are not maintained. We do not store any information that can be used to identify the users either. All logs are wiped out on a routine basis to add to organizational efficiency and security of the users that rely upon us to maintain their privacy. What if I accidentally closed the browser window before confirmation of my transfer? There is no need for concern. You do not have to stay at the page once the incoming address is delivered. Transfers are automatically processed according the order lot over 24 hours. Can I trust you with large amounts of BTC? Our reserves are publicly proven on BitcoinTalk (1, 2, 3). We do not profit by running away with your coins but by rather running longer in the business.

The code within the mixer ensure your coins are never mixed with your own coin and sent back. This ensures security, transparency and anonymity Support Create Ticket Get in touch.
