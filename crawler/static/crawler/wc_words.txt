Dark Mixer anonymous bitcoin mixer Home Login Register How to get perfectly anonymous bitcoins in 3 easy steps: Step 1: Sign up at Dark Mixer and send bitcoins from your old wallet to your new Dark Mixer wallet. Step 2: Wait a random amount of time, ideally a few days. Step 3: Withdraw your bitcoins as you need them to make payments. If you send $300 worth of bitcoins to the Dark Mixer, and withdraw in smaller parts of for example $50, $100, $80, then there will be no possibility at all to even guess which transaction is yours, and which belongs to another user. Why most other mixers are NOT safe at all: 1. If they are on the clearweb, then they will be seized sooner or later, like for example bestmixer. Even if they do not keep logs, law enforcement can monitor the server since it is no problem to find and seize clearweb servers. 2. Most mixers do not use a wallet, you send X bitcoins to them, and they send X bitcoins minus fee back. This is super easy to deanonymize for blockchain analytics companies! Conclusion: Only use dark web wallets like Dark Mixer as a mixer to keep your bitcoins anonymous. There are currently no fees except the bitcoin network fees for using the mixer. We are earning BTC from other sites and are cleaning our coins on this mixer, so we do not need a fee to run this service. This might change in the future and we might charge a small fee, but we will give notice in advance. No reason to pay a high fee to mixers which do not even work. Stay safe. Dark Mixer

Dark Mixer anonymous bitcoin mixer Home Login Register How to get perfectly anonymous bitcoins in 3 easy steps: Step 1: Sign up at Dark Mixer and send bitcoins from your old wallet to your new Dark Mixer wallet. Step 2: Wait a random amount of time, ideally a few days. Step 3: Withdraw your bitcoins as you need them to make payments. If you send $300 worth of bitcoins to the Dark Mixer, and withdraw in smaller parts of for example $50, $100, $80, then there will be no possibility at all to even guess which transaction is yours, and which belongs to another user. Why most other mixers are NOT safe at all: 1. If they are on the clearweb, then they will be seized sooner or later, like for example bestmixer. Even if they do not keep logs, law enforcement can monitor the server since it is no problem to find and seize clearweb servers. 2. Most mixers do not use a wallet, you send X bitcoins to them, and they send X bitcoins minus fee back. This is super easy to deanonymize for blockchain analytics companies! Conclusion: Only use dark web wallets like Dark Mixer as a mixer to keep your bitcoins anonymous. There are currently no fees except the bitcoin network fees for using the mixer. We are earning BTC from other sites and are cleaning our coins on this mixer, so we do not need a fee to run this service. This might change in the future and we might charge a small fee, but we will give notice in advance. No reason to pay a high fee to mixers which do not even work. Stay safe. Dark Mixer
