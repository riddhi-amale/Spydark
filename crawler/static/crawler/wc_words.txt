Darkode - The Hidden Wiki DarkodeFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to searchOperation Shrouded Horìzon Cyber Criminal Forum Taken Down Members in 20 Countries Arrested JULY 2015 FBI It was, in effect, a one-stop, high-volume shopping venue for some of the world’s most prolific cyber criminals. Called Darkode, this underground, password-protected, online forum was a meeting place for those interested in buying, selling, and trading malware, botnets, stolen personally identifiable information, credit card information, hacked server credentials, and other pieces of data and software that facilitated complex cyber crimes all over the globe. Unbeknownst to the operators of this invitation-only, English-speaking criminal forum, though, the FBI had infiltrated this communication platform at the highest levels and began collecting evidence and intelligence on Darkode members. And today, the Department of Justice and the FBI—with the assistance of our partners in 19 countries around the world—announced the results of Operation Shrouded Horizon, a multi-agency investigation into the Darkode forum. Among those results were charges, arrests, and searches involving 70 Darkode members and associates around the world; U.S. indictments against 12 individuals associated with the forum, including its administrator; the serving of several search warrants in the U.S.; and the Bureau’s seizure of Darkode’s domain and servers. View Clearnet Image Domain Seizure Message left on Darkode's homepage after the FBI seized its web domain and servers. Said FBI Deputy Director Mark Giuliano, “Cyber criminals should not have a safe haven to shop for the tools of their trade, and Operation Shrouded Horizon shows we will do all we can to disrupt their unlawful activities.” During the investigation, the Bureau focused primarily on the Darkode members responsible for developing, distributing, facilitating, and supporting the most egregious and complex cyber criminal schemes targeting victims and financial systems around the world, including in the United States. The Darkode forum, which had between 250-300 members, operated very carefully—not just anyone could join. Ever fearful of compromise by law enforcement, Darkode administrators made sure prospective members were heavily vetted. Similar to practices used by the Mafia, a potential candidate for forum membership had to be sponsored by an existing member and sent a formal invitation to join. In response, the candidate had to post an online introduction—basically, a resume—highlighting the individual’s past criminal activity, particular cyber skills, and potential contributions to the forum. The forum’s active members decided whether to approve applications. Once in the forum, members—in addition to buying and selling criminal cyber products and services—used it to exchange ideas, knowledge, and advice on any number of cyber-related fraud schemes and other illegal activities. It was almost like a think tank for cyber criminals. What’s the significance of this case, believed to be the largest-ever coordinated law enforcement effort directed at an online cyber criminal forum? In addition to shutting down a major resource for cyber criminals, law enforcement infiltrated a closed criminal forum—no easy task—to obtain the intelligence and evidence needed to identity and prosecute these criminals. And this action paid off with a treasure trove of information that ultimately led to the dismantlement of the forum and law enforcement actions against dozens of its worst criminal members around the world. The case was led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, with assistance from our offices in Washington, San Diego, and a number of others around the country. But it wouldn’t have happened without the support of Europol and other partners in 19 countries. And in addition to the FBI obtaining enough evidence for search warrants and indictments in the U.S., we shared information with our foreign partners to help them make their own cases against the Darkode perpetrators residing in their jurisdictions. Operation Shrouded Horizon is a prime example of why the most effective way to combat cyber crime — which operates globally — is a law enforcement response that also transcends national borders.

Darkode - The Hidden Wiki DarkodeFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to searchOperation Shrouded Horìzon Cyber Criminal Forum Taken Down Members in 20 Countries Arrested JULY 2015 FBI It was, in effect, a one-stop, high-volume shopping venue for some of the world’s most prolific cyber criminals. Called Darkode, this underground, password-protected, online forum was a meeting place for those interested in buying, selling, and trading malware, botnets, stolen personally identifiable information, credit card information, hacked server credentials, and other pieces of data and software that facilitated complex cyber crimes all over the globe. Unbeknownst to the operators of this invitation-only, English-speaking criminal forum, though, the FBI had infiltrated this communication platform at the highest levels and began collecting evidence and intelligence on Darkode members. And today, the Department of Justice and the FBI—with the assistance of our partners in 19 countries around the world—announced the results of Operation Shrouded Horizon, a multi-agency investigation into the Darkode forum. Among those results were charges, arrests, and searches involving 70 Darkode members and associates around the world; U.S. indictments against 12 individuals associated with the forum, including its administrator; the serving of several search warrants in the U.S.; and the Bureau’s seizure of Darkode’s domain and servers. View Clearnet Image Domain Seizure Message left on Darkode's homepage after the FBI seized its web domain and servers. Said FBI Deputy Director Mark Giuliano, “Cyber criminals should not have a safe haven to shop for the tools of their trade, and Operation Shrouded Horizon shows we will do all we can to disrupt their unlawful activities.” During the investigation, the Bureau focused primarily on the Darkode members responsible for developing, distributing, facilitating, and supporting the most egregious and complex cyber criminal schemes targeting victims and financial systems around the world, including in the United States. The Darkode forum, which had between 250-300 members, operated very carefully—not just anyone could join. Ever fearful of compromise by law enforcement, Darkode administrators made sure prospective members were heavily vetted. Similar to practices used by the Mafia, a potential candidate for forum membership had to be sponsored by an existing member and sent a formal invitation to join. In response, the candidate had to post an online introduction—basically, a resume—highlighting the individual’s past criminal activity, particular cyber skills, and potential contributions to the forum. The forum’s active members decided whether to approve applications. Once in the forum, members—in addition to buying and selling criminal cyber products and services—used it to exchange ideas, knowledge, and advice on any number of cyber-related fraud schemes and other illegal activities. It was almost like a think tank for cyber criminals. What’s the significance of this case, believed to be the largest-ever coordinated law enforcement effort directed at an online cyber criminal forum? In addition to shutting down a major resource for cyber criminals, law enforcement infiltrated a closed criminal forum—no easy task—to obtain the intelligence and evidence needed to identity and prosecute these criminals. And this action paid off with a treasure trove of information that ultimately led to the dismantlement of the forum and law enforcement actions against dozens of its worst criminal members around the world. The case was led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, with assistance from our offices in Washington, San Diego, and a number of others around the country. But it wouldn’t have happened without the support of Europol and other partners in 19 countries. And in addition to the FBI obtaining enough evidence for search warrants and indictments in the U.S., we shared information with our foreign partners to help them make their own cases against the Darkode perpetrators residing in their jurisdictions. Operation Shrouded Horizon is a prime example of why the most effective way to combat cyber crime — which operates globally — is a law enforcement response that also transcends national borders.

Operation Torpedo - The Hidden Wiki Operation TorpedoFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to search Operatìon Torpedo FBI Uses Web's Favorite Hacking Tool To Unmask Tor Users DECEMBER 2014 KEVIN POULSEN FOR MORE THAN a decade, a powerful app called Metasploit has been the most important tool in the hacking world: An open-source Swiss Army knife of hacks that puts the latest exploits in the hands of anyone who’s interested, from random criminals to the thousands of security professionals who rely on the app to scour client networks for holes. Now Metasploit has a new and surprising fan: the FBI. WIRED has learned that FBI agents relied on Flash code from an abandoned Metasploit side project called the “Decloaking Engine” to stage its first known effort to successfully identify a multitude of suspects hiding behind the Tor anonymity network. That attack, “Operation Torpedo,” was a 2012 sting operation targeting users of three Dark Net child porn sites. Now an attorney for one of the defendants ensnared by the code is challenging the reliability of the hackerware, arguing it may not meet Supreme Court standards for the admission of scientific evidence. “The judge decided that I would be entitled to retain an expert,” says Omaha defense attorney Joseph Gross. “That’s where I am on this—getting a programming expert involved to examine what the government has characterized as a Flash application attack of the Tor network.” A hearing on the matter is set for February 23. Tor, a free, open-source project originally funded by the US Navy, is sophisticated anonymity software that protects users by routing traffic through a labyrinthine delta of encrypted connections. Like any encryption or privacy system, Tor is popular with criminals. But it also is used by human rights workers, activists, journalists and whistleblowers worldwide. Indeed, much of the funding for Tor comes from grants issued by federal agencies like the State Department that have a vested interest in supporting safe, anonymous speech for dissidents living under oppressive regimes. With so many legitimate users depending upon the system, any successful attack on Tor raises alarm and prompts questions, even when the attacker is a law enforcement agency operating under a court order. Did the FBI develop its own attack code, or outsource it to a contractor? Was the NSA involved? Were any innocent users ensnared? Read more.

Operation Torsploit - The Hidden Wiki Operation TorsploitFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to search Operatìon Torsploit The Metasploit Decloaking Engine → Aaron McGrath and the FBI → The FBI v. Tor → How the FBI did it.→ I was originally going to make this post on the one year anniversary of the FH Java script attack, but that whole situation with Wired kind of took the wind out of my sails. Anyway this thread is going to include a final summary of the FBIs war on Tor, my thoughts and theories and i'm going to answer some questions people have been asking me. The FBI's campaign against Tor has been ongoing for years and it seemed as recently as June 2012 all of their efforts had been in vain as this article was published http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/06/14/fbi-tor-child-abuse-investigation/ However, just 5 months later they launched Operation Torpedo the first successful mass deployment of their CIPAV/NIT code against a network of .onion child porn sites ran by Aaron Mcgrath who is now serving 20 years in prison. Aaron McGrath was convicted and sentenced for the crime of Engaging in a Child Exploitation Enterprise. McGrath was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment. After his release from prison he will begin a 10 year term of supervised release. McGrath created and operated three separate websites dedicated to advertising and distributing child pornography between January 2009 and November 2012. McGrath administered the websites from his workplace, a server farm in Bellevue, Nebraska, and from his home in Omaha, Nebraska. The websites, named PedoBoard, PedoBook and TB3 were only accessible on the TOR network. The TOR network facilitates anonymous and, for the most part, untraceable communications by users. One of the sites had 5,600 members, 3,000 message threads and 24,000 postings as of December 2012. Sub-forums included sections of child pornography involving: Babies; Prepubescent Boys; Prepubescent Girls; Teenage Boys and Teenage Girls. The text area of the site included a forum devoted to pedophilia. One site alone contained well over 10,000 child pornography images with the youngest victims being infants and toddlers. The investigation has resulted in 25 additional defendants discovered using one or more of McGrath’s boards on the TOR network. ~ Justice.gov Operation Torpedo: November 15- December 5 (this is a broad estimate, I can't find the document that has the exact deployment dates at this time) The attack: The actual method employed in deploying this attack is unknown at this time but it's assumed that it was a similar attack to the one used on Freedom Hosting. The two attacks do have some distinct differences, mac addresses and host names were NOT collected during Operation Torpedo and there is evidence that suggests this attack may have worked against Linux and Mac. The Arrests: There were 25 defendants, however only 14 defendants are named in any court documents. The unnamed defendants are listed as John Does, it's unclear why at this moment, this will be covered further in the theories and thoughts section. The 14 who WERE arrested were all subject to simultaneous raids a little over 4 months after the FBI operation. Their is no evidence that any of the defendants discovered the code that was used. Why this is relevant will be touched on later. The Defendants: JASON FLANARY, TIMOTHY DEFOGGI, ZACKARY AUSTIN, RUSSELL GLENN PIERCE, DAVID WILLIAM PEER, JOSHUA WELCH, THOMAS SPENCER, BRANDON MOORE, JOHN SEBES, GARY REIBERT, VINCENT DIBERARDINO, MICHAEL HUYCK, KIRK COTTOM, KEVIN M. PITMAN, The motion to suppress: The code was deployed under the authority of a a search warrant out of Nebraska. The defendants have attempted to suppress any evidence obtained due to the failure of the FBI to notify them of the search within the required 30 days. The 30 day requirement is a non essential element of the 4th amendment and violation of this rule rarely results in suppression. This will be covered in much more depth in the thoughts and theories section. The Torsploit: Servers under control July 22nd The code deployed July 31- August 5 The first indication that something was wrong was when many people starting July 22nd started reporting outages of popular FH sites, such as Tormail. No one even considered that it was apart of an ongoing law enforcement operation. Just weeks later Erik Eoin Marques was indicted in the US and his servers were serving up malware. In the hysteria that followed much false information was spread. Many claimed this was just a "dry run" and no arrests of criminals would be made, this I can tell you 100% is false. Then the other big one was that this was an NSA operation, also false. The attack collected the victim's mac address and host name then sent it to FBI servers in Virginia using the victims clearnet IP. However there is one thing that almost no one discussed immediately following the attack, the tracking cookie. The only known arrest is a man named Grant Klein of Vermont, they were able to describe in great detail exactly what he was doing on the sites he visited, the tracking cookie is the only way this could be accomplished. Grant Klein: After hours of sifting through legal documents and following leads I have been unable to find any additional arrests. Grant is the only named suspect in either Operation Torpedo or the Torsploit to receive press coverage at the time of his arrest. Mr. Klein was arrested about 3 1/2 months after the FH exploit. In that time he had destroyed his hard drive, at some point felt "safe" and restarted his illegal conduct. When the FBI showed up at his door he took the route of cooperation. The case was originally filed in Maryland but the FH related charges were dropped at some point and he was charged in his home state of Vermont for images he had stored on his phone. He is now awaiting sentencing after taking a plea deal. The Judge assigned to his case is known for leniency in child porn cases.

Darkode - The Hidden Wiki DarkodeFrom The Hidden WikiRevision as of 02:54, 10 August 2015 by · DEA · cyber · FBI · crimes · DOJ · (talk | contribs)(diff) ← Older revision | Latest revision (diff) | Newer revision → (diff)Jump to navigationJump to searchOperation Shrouded Horìzon Cyber Criminal Forum Taken Down Members in 20 Countries Arrested JULY 2015 FBI It was, in effect, a one-stop, high-volume shopping venue for some of the world’s most prolific cyber criminals. Called Darkode, this underground, password-protected, online forum was a meeting place for those interested in buying, selling, and trading malware, botnets, stolen personally identifiable information, credit card information, hacked server credentials, and other pieces of data and software that facilitated complex cyber crimes all over the globe. Unbeknownst to the operators of this invitation-only, English-speaking criminal forum, though, the FBI had infiltrated this communication platform at the highest levels and began collecting evidence and intelligence on Darkode members. And today, the Department of Justice and the FBI—with the assistance of our partners in 19 countries around the world—announced the results of Operation Shrouded Horizon, a multi-agency investigation into the Darkode forum. Among those results were charges, arrests, and searches involving 70 Darkode members and associates around the world; U.S. indictments against 12 individuals associated with the forum, including its administrator; the serving of several search warrants in the U.S.; and the Bureau’s seizure of Darkode’s domain and servers. View Clearnet Image Domain Seizure Message left on Darkode's homepage after the FBI seized its web domain and servers. Said FBI Deputy Director Mark Giuliano, “Cyber criminals should not have a safe haven to shop for the tools of their trade, and Operation Shrouded Horizon shows we will do all we can to disrupt their unlawful activities.” During the investigation, the Bureau focused primarily on the Darkode members responsible for developing, distributing, facilitating, and supporting the most egregious and complex cyber criminal schemes targeting victims and financial systems around the world, including in the United States. The Darkode forum, which had between 250-300 members, operated very carefully—not just anyone could join. Ever fearful of compromise by law enforcement, Darkode administrators made sure prospective members were heavily vetted. Similar to practices used by the Mafia, a potential candidate for forum membership had to be sponsored by an existing member and sent a formal invitation to join. In response, the candidate had to post an online introduction—basically, a resume—highlighting the individual’s past criminal activity, particular cyber skills, and potential contributions to the forum. The forum’s active members decided whether to approve applications. Once in the forum, members—in addition to buying and selling criminal cyber products and services—used it to exchange ideas, knowledge, and advice on any number of cyber-related fraud schemes and other illegal activities. It was almost like a think tank for cyber criminals. What’s the significance of this case, believed to be the largest-ever coordinated law enforcement effort directed at an online cyber criminal forum? In addition to shutting down a major resource for cyber criminals, law enforcement infiltrated a closed criminal forum—no easy task—to obtain the intelligence and evidence needed to identity and prosecute these criminals. And this action paid off with a treasure trove of information that ultimately led to the dismantlement of the forum and law enforcement actions against dozens of its worst criminal members around the world. The case was led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, with assistance from our offices in Washington, San Diego, and a number of others around the country. But it wouldn’t have happened without the support of Europol and other partners in 19 countries. And in addition to the FBI obtaining enough evidence for search warrants and indictments in the U.S., we shared information with our foreign partners to help them make their own cases against the Darkode perpetrators residing in their jurisdictions. Operation Shrouded Horizon is a prime example of why the most effective way to combat cyber crime — which operates globally — is a law enforcement response that also transcends national borders.

Hidden Services - Other Protocols Volunteers last verified that all services in this section were up, or marked as DOWN, on: 2011-06-08 For configuration and service/uptime testing, all services in this section MUST list the active port in their address. Exception: HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443. For help with configuration, see the TorifyHOWTO and End-to-end connectivity issues. P2P FileSharing Running P2P protocols within Tor requires OnionCat. Therefore, see the OnionCat section for those P2P services. IMPORTANT: It is possible to use Tor for P2P. However, if you do, the right thing must also be done by giving back the bandwidth used. Otherwise, if this is not done, Tor will be crushed taking everyone along with it. The Pirate Bay - The Pirate Bay.

Services can go down temporarily, so we keep track of when they do and maintain a list of dead hidden services. In addition to an onion simply being gone (Tor cannot resolve the onion), sites that display 404 (and use a known onion/URL based hosting service) are the only other thing that is considered truly DOWN. Presumably the account is gone. If a service has been down for a while, tag it with ' - DOWN YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went down). If a tagged service on the above list of live hidden services has come back up, remove the DOWN tag. If a tagged service is still down after a month, please move it (along with the DOWN tag) to the list of dead hidden services. The general idea of the remaining four service states below is that, if the Hidden Service Descriptor is available, and something is responding behind it... the service is considered up, and we track that fact on the Main Page. If any of these subsequently go offline, append the DOWN tag and handle as above. Hello world's / statements, minimal sites, services with low user activity, etc (while boring)... are listed as usual. Broken services are those that display 404 (and do not use a known hosting service), PHP or other errors (or they fail silently)... any of which prevent the use of the service as intended. They also include blank pages, empty dirs and neglected status notes. Presumably the operator is in limbo. Broken services are tagged with ' (reason) - Broken YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went broken) Services that automatically redirect to another service (such as by HTTP protocol or script), have their redirection destinations noted in their descriptions. These are tagged with ' - Redir YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went redir) Sites that are formally closed via announcement are tagged with ' - Closed YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went closed. Is Online that HiddenService? This service is very useful in determining whether onions are up or not. It also gives a reason why they are down. Sites on this list that have no chance of coming back (LE takedowns, dead for some time) should be archived to page dead services just in case they should ever be needed.

Siterules - The Hidden Wiki SiterulesFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to searchRules of the Hidden Wiki The Hidden Wiki is basically a big (the biggest?) directory of working websites, it serves as a directory of links to other .onion sites. To maintain some order here, a few simple rules must be followed. On the Main Page: No vandalizing of links (For example: changing the URLs by one letter) No phishing (For example: changing the legit URLs to some phishing URL) No deleting of working links (except if they are down for a longer period of time.) Only TOR sites (ending with .onion) are allowed. Changing URLs to clearnet ones (to 'onion.to', or to 'tor2web' for example) will be treated as vandalism. The Main Page is a big, neutral .onion directory. Let's keep it that way: If you have opinions about a site, use the Talk pages for that. Financial/Commercial services: The "Financial" and "Commercial" sections are special sections here, because there is a healthy competition going on between the vendors. That is why these sections have the most revisions and changes. The site would like to offer every vendor an equally fair chance, so there are some special rules for these two sections, to provide these equal chances. Because the HW is still a directory of links, and is not someone's personal advertising platform, the following rules apply: In the Financial/Commercial sections: No bold text, no fancy wrappers. Every link must look the same for a visitor. No hosting of commercial/financial services on the Hidden Wiki. If you have something to sell, then rent/create a host, like others do. The Hidden Wiki is not a hosting provider. A single image does not qualify as a website. Since the HW is a directory of websites, linking to a single image is not allowed. Just like above: use a webserver, set up a website, like the others do. Vendors are competing for 'spots'. If you're a new user with a new site, please don't trigger an edit war: respect the vendors who were here before, and do not put a new link on the top of the already established list. These rules are not very strict, and are easy to follow. Anyone who strikingly disobeys them is risking his username here. Other notes: Please note that almost anyone can edit the regular pages, there is minimal protection on them.(That means, if you write something somewhere, nobody guarantees that it will be there tomorrow. This is the nature of the Hidden Wiki: information that others find useless may perish. The solution: write only things that the community can benefit from. You can earn some respect that way.) Rules last updated: 28 May 2014 SITE DISCLAIMER This hidden website (The "Hidden Wiki") is a community editable directory, and information source. The site holds no responsibility for the content uploaded by it's users, for the validity of the information presented here, or for the content of external sites. The administrator(s) of the site does not have the capacity to check and/or validate every link and every information uploaded here. Every uploader holds full responsibility for the content he/she uploads. The Hidden Wiki does not verify or mark services in any way. Please bear in mind that anybody can contribute to the Wiki, so just because something is written here, it doesn't necessarily mean it's true. While in general, we're asking our users to not link to websites with illegal content on them, this term is relative to the country where the linked website resides in. We cannot check that either. So, it is possible that some of the links you find here can take you to places you'll find inappropriate. It is your responsibility to do your research before using any information here. Legality: This website is a community editable public directory, basically a big bunch of links to working .Onion sites. There is no illegal content hosted on our servers. If you find one however, please leave a message about it on the admin's talk page. The Hidden Wiki is a 100% free service. It does not, and will not accept payments of any kind. No exceptions. If anyone asks for money (or coins) for their services regarding the Hidden Wiki, it is very likely that he is a scammer, and you will pay for an otherwise free service (or worse: you'll pay for nothing). Pay at your own discretion.

Darkode - The Hidden Wiki DarkodeFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to searchOperation Shrouded Horìzon Cyber Criminal Forum Taken Down Members in 20 Countries Arrested JULY 2015 FBI It was, in effect, a one-stop, high-volume shopping venue for some of the world’s most prolific cyber criminals. Called Darkode, this underground, password-protected, online forum was a meeting place for those interested in buying, selling, and trading malware, botnets, stolen personally identifiable information, credit card information, hacked server credentials, and other pieces of data and software that facilitated complex cyber crimes all over the globe. Unbeknownst to the operators of this invitation-only, English-speaking criminal forum, though, the FBI had infiltrated this communication platform at the highest levels and began collecting evidence and intelligence on Darkode members. And today, the Department of Justice and the FBI—with the assistance of our partners in 19 countries around the world—announced the results of Operation Shrouded Horizon, a multi-agency investigation into the Darkode forum. Among those results were charges, arrests, and searches involving 70 Darkode members and associates around the world; U.S. indictments against 12 individuals associated with the forum, including its administrator; the serving of several search warrants in the U.S.; and the Bureau’s seizure of Darkode’s domain and servers. View Clearnet Image Domain Seizure Message left on Darkode's homepage after the FBI seized its web domain and servers. Said FBI Deputy Director Mark Giuliano, “Cyber criminals should not have a safe haven to shop for the tools of their trade, and Operation Shrouded Horizon shows we will do all we can to disrupt their unlawful activities.” During the investigation, the Bureau focused primarily on the Darkode members responsible for developing, distributing, facilitating, and supporting the most egregious and complex cyber criminal schemes targeting victims and financial systems around the world, including in the United States. The Darkode forum, which had between 250-300 members, operated very carefully—not just anyone could join. Ever fearful of compromise by law enforcement, Darkode administrators made sure prospective members were heavily vetted. Similar to practices used by the Mafia, a potential candidate for forum membership had to be sponsored by an existing member and sent a formal invitation to join. In response, the candidate had to post an online introduction—basically, a resume—highlighting the individual’s past criminal activity, particular cyber skills, and potential contributions to the forum. The forum’s active members decided whether to approve applications. Once in the forum, members—in addition to buying and selling criminal cyber products and services—used it to exchange ideas, knowledge, and advice on any number of cyber-related fraud schemes and other illegal activities. It was almost like a think tank for cyber criminals. What’s the significance of this case, believed to be the largest-ever coordinated law enforcement effort directed at an online cyber criminal forum? In addition to shutting down a major resource for cyber criminals, law enforcement infiltrated a closed criminal forum—no easy task—to obtain the intelligence and evidence needed to identity and prosecute these criminals. And this action paid off with a treasure trove of information that ultimately led to the dismantlement of the forum and law enforcement actions against dozens of its worst criminal members around the world. The case was led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, with assistance from our offices in Washington, San Diego, and a number of others around the country. But it wouldn’t have happened without the support of Europol and other partners in 19 countries. And in addition to the FBI obtaining enough evidence for search warrants and indictments in the U.S., we shared information with our foreign partners to help them make their own cases against the Darkode perpetrators residing in their jurisdictions. Operation Shrouded Horizon is a prime example of why the most effective way to combat cyber crime — which operates globally — is a law enforcement response that also transcends national borders.

Operation Shrouded Horizon is a prime example of why the most effective way to combat cyber crime — which operates globally — is a law enforcement response that also transcends national borders.

Bitbazaar features Bitask (users can ask what they need) Bithow (tutorials on BB), BitAuction (auctions system) and supports multicurrency payment. DarkMarket features BTC and XMR payment + Bitmessage notifications. As users are mostly moving to those markets, we have featured them. You can use banners or links (on homepage) to register. SIGNED MESSAGE FROM APOLLON HEAD MOD - JANUARY 30, 2020 Official pgp signed message from Apollon mod : Download ABOUT APOLLON - JANUARY 29, 2020 System-related accounts got downgraded to regular members (=customers). We are still awaiting for the market administrators to publish an official update. Please customers, do not place new orders until we have more updates. ABOUT APOLLON - JANUARY 28, 2020 Some vendors reported on Reddit that they could not log into their accounts anymore. We do not think Apollon is exiting but just having some piece of maintenance work. Users are advised to message support if they encounter problems with withdrawing or placing orders. We are contacting Apollon support. We will keep you posted as often as possible. ABOUT EMPIRE, GREY, YB - JANUARY 3, 2020 The Grey and Yellowbrick servers aren't responding for several days which means they may be exit scamming, have been compromised or are having serious issues. Empire is up but captcha is locked (ie : maybe ' purposedly ' locked, like Berlusconi did). In case they would come back to life, we advise everyone to remain very cautious and move to other markets MESSAGE FROM RAPTOR ADMIN - DECEMBER 29, 2019 It's been about 8 months that Raptor hidden service has been set up, and the traffic is constantly growing. I would like to thank all our Dread subscribers, partners vendors shops, Apollon staff, Dark Market staff, BitBazaar staff, Monopoly staff, Avior staff, Sonar team for their backlinks and support. I would also like to thank all the customers that reported nefarious webshops or scammers, because darknet is needing more trust everyday. I would also like to inform all users that the new features we announced a few months ago are finally entering their last testing days. With this new tool, you will be able to easily spot scammers and browse the darknet safer than ever. Finally, we are still open to reputable vendors and shops collaborations, also we are willing to support new markets : if you own a new market that is built on security, you can message me and I will eventually add it to new markets list. Final words : I wish everyone the best NYE possible. Stay safe, stay strong, and stay away from fake products ! NIGHTMARE'S CREATIVE DOXXED - DECEMBER 21, 2019 The former Nightmare market administrator, who exit scammed with users' BTC, has been exposed. Nightmare server got hacked : http://nightmareocykhgs.onion MERRY CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS - DECEMBER 19, 2019 We have updated several links. We wish everyone nice christmas holidays. NEW CLEARNET DOMAIN : RAPTOR.LIFE - DECEMBER 13, 2019 We are very glad to announce we are now reachable over the clearnet : Raptor dot Life ! ABOUT TOCHKA & EMPIRE - DECEMBER 8, 2019 All Tochka mirrors are down since more than a whole week. Due to the rotating mirrors on Empire , and the very short time they are up, plus the huge amount of tickets unanswered on that market, we recommend Empire users moving to another marketplace. ABOUT CRYPTONIA- NOVEMBER 23, 2019 Cryptonia market issued a PGP signed message saying they would restore the market on january 2020. All current disputes would be closed with a 50/50 refund. Maybe they will ' indeed ' come back, but Cryptonia market must be used with care considering it may have been compromised in the meanwhile. We flagged the market with a Warning sign. Samsara market still down. Added 1 mirror for BitBazaar. Updated mirrors for DarkMarket. If you have trouble connecting to DarkMarket using those mirrors, feel free to remove the ref part ('/ref') Stay safe ! UPDATE - NOVEMBER 23, 2019 Added several active Empire market mirrors UPDATE - NOVEMBER 22, 2019 Cryptonia market servers are up since a few days, but people cannot log in. Market may be compromised or exiting. If the market comes back to life, you should use it with extreme awareness. Samsara servers are unreachable. Empire market issued new mirrors , we have updated the list. Grey market is facing a severe DDos. UPDATE - NOVEMBER 15, 2019 Agartha market has been removed from the trusted markets list. ABOUT SECMAIL & RAPTOR CHAT- NOVEMBER 4, 2019 Many people, over the past weeks, did ask us why SecMail hasn't been listed as a mailbox provider. That is : why is Torbox better than SecMail in our opinion ? 1. Torbox is relying on donations, while SecMail displays lot of advertisements. 2. These ads are often leading to scam markets / scam shops. 3. We do not want to vouch for a mailbox provider that is fueled by scammers. If you want to run your own alternative to Torbox, you can do it with setting up SquirrelMail on a server : https://squirrelmail.org/ About the Raptor chat. Please do not forget to close your session before leaving the chat page, otherwise you will remain with an online status. If you are unsure people are actually online or forgot to clase their sessions, PM them so they will notice your messages once they connect back. We may relaunch the forum soon. If volunteers are willing to take care of it - the forum - they can message us on Jabber, Wickr or send us a message to our Torbox. DEEPWEB MARKETS REVIEW - OCTOBER 23, 2019 Every customer that got scammed with proof , must contact us as soon as possible so we can eventually add the vendor to the scammers section. Too many people fall into obvious traps : cloned credit cards, WU transfers, Paypal transfers (that mostly are blocked once the funds reach their destination). DEEPWEB MARKETS REVIEW - OCTOBER 5, 2019 Berlusconi market mods stated in their SubDread that they trying to crack their own captcha problems. Market is likely exit scamming and has been removed off the markets list DEEPWEB MARKETS REVIEW - OCTOBER 1, 2019 Berlusconi seems to encounter problems with login page loading again and again, even if the entered captcha is valid. Some Empire markets mirrors do not work, so you must try them all. We now have a partnership with TAPE news, which is a great deepdotweb-like website. We now also have a Subdread. Go check the links on mainpage ! DEEPWEB MARKETS REVIEW - SEPTEMBER 28, 2019 Genesis has exit scammed and is now removed from the marketplaces list. We are in contact with a forthcoming marketplace owner, which seems very promising. It will be listed up as soon as it will be fully working. Also, thanks to the Monopoly marketplace team to soon add our link as a trusted links supplier ! We believe that the more marketplaces there are, the more LE must put effort in to take them down. There would be no surprise however, one or two marketplaces will dominate the game soon. Stay tuned. DEEPWEB MARKETS REVIEW - SEPTEMBER 16, 2019 As you can see, we have featured some deepweb markets with a star. The reason is we think those markets have exclusive features, are well-established, or are going to reach the top markets list one day. Genesis market and mirrors have been recently unstable, showing up then off. Some big community in the darknet is experiencing a downtime. Some customers and complain they were not able to withdraw their funds off Genesis, so use with care in the coming days. If nothing changes up quickly, the star will be removed and replaced with the warning sign. DEEPWEB MARKETS REVIEW - SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 While Berlusconi Market has the most products, Empire Market remains a favourite for many customers. This may be caused by his design that reminds an old popular market. Apollon remains a stable and trustwhorty market with responsive support, while DarkMarket, Genesis , should start growing soon. Amongst those emerging markets, BitBazaar brings new features such as auctions, internal reviews, and various currencies support. Apollon, DarkMarket, BitBazaar, and maybe Monopoly (FE-only) deserve customers attention.

This will launch the GUI installer. Depending on how your computer is set up, you may be able to start the installer by double-clicking the "i2pinstall_0.9.49.jar" file or right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with Java". Unfortunately, this behaviour is difficult to predict. Command line (headless) install: I2P can also be installed in a terminal environment, which may be especially useful for servers, containers, or certain virtual machines. If you wish to use the installer without a GUI, you can use the command java -jar i2pinstall_0.9.49.jar -console to follow the install procedure in your terminal. i2pinstall_0.9.49.jar Mirror: sigterm.no select alternate mirror sig 1614da8703b43e5bdc55007c784f2c211d00650ae0308273605d2ddc321b807e The most reliable way to launch the installer is from a terminal like this: java -jar i2pinstall_0.9.49.jar.

Ricochet Ricochet About Latest changes GitHub Sponsors Anonymous instant messaging for real privacy Ricochet is a different approach to instant messaging that doesn’t trust anyone in protecting your privacy. Eliminate metadata. Nobody knows who you are, who you talk to, or what you say. Stay anonymous. Share what you want, without sharing your identity and location. Nobody in the middle. There are no servers to monitor, censor, or hack. Safe by default. Security isn’t secure until it’s automatic and easy to use. Get started Windows Mac Linux The latest version is 1.1.4 (November 5, 2016). You can also build from source. How it works Ricochet uses the Tor network to reach your contacts without relying on messaging servers. It creates a hidden service, which is used to rendezvous with your contacts without revealing your location or IP address. Instead of a username, you get a unique address that looks like ricochet:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw. Other Ricochet users can use this address to send a contact request - asking to be added to your contacts list. You can see when your contacts are online, and send them messages (and soon, files!). Your list of contacts is only known to your computer - never exposed to servers or network traffic monitoring. Everything is encrypted end-to-end, so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, and anonymized, so nobody knows where it’s going and where it came from. For more information, you can read about Tor and learn more about Ricochet’s design. Be careful Ricochet is an experiment. Security and anonymity are difficult topics, and you should carefully evaluate your risks and exposure with any software. We’re working on auditing, reviewing, and always improving Ricochet (and we’d love more help). There will be problems. We hope to do better than most, but please, don’t risk your safety any more than necessary. How to help Bugs and features should be discussed on the issue tracker. Translations can be contributed on Transifex. Patches are accepted and encouraged on GitHub or by email. Ricochet is maintained by John Brooks, who can be reached at: ricochet:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw or john.brooks@dereferenced.net (pgp). You should support The Tor Project, EFF, and run a Tor relay. Ricochet is free and open-source software, made with love and dedication by its contributors. Find out more about this website.

This page contains links to the most recently built binaries for each Tox client. Keep in mind that these clients are alpha software under heavy development, and are probably not ready for day-to-day use. Because of how significantly the code is still changing, a professional audit hasn't yet been started. You will probably run into various usability bugs, and may even encounter dangerous security vulnerabilities. That having been said, hundreds of people around the world have devoted time, effort, and resources to the project in an effort to make Tox as secure as possible. While open source projects are not immune to serious longstanding security vulnerabilities, their threat is greatly reduced, as the code is open for anyone to review. Over time, as Tox gets closer to being stable, a proper security audit will be conducted, and the code will be checked thoroughly for any possible security concerns.

This repository is not active anymore because irungentoo wants any changes to be reviewed and approved by him, but he has been unable to find time to work on Toxcore to do the said reviews and approvals. In order to continue the development of Toxcore, the TokTok/c-toxcore non-hostile fork has been made by active Toxcore developers where the development is currently ongoing. If you are deciding which Toxcore to use, TokTok/c-toxcore is the right one. TokTok/c-toxcore TokTok/c-toxcore is a non-hostile fork of the original irungentoo/toxcore. The fork was made by active Toxcore developers due to irungentoo wanting to review and approve any changes submitted into his repository, but being unable to do so as he is unable to find time to work on Toxcore. This is the Toxcore that is being actively developed and this is also the Toxcore that all clients use.

XMPP - Wikipedia XMPP From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) Jump to navigation Jump to search Not to be confused with XAMPP, a web server software stack, or Extreme Memory Profile (XMP), a memory overclocking standard. Communications protocol for message-oriented middleware XMPPInternational standardRFC 6120 (Core) (2011) RFC 6121 (IM & Presence) (2011) RFC 7622 (Address Format) (2015) RFC 3922 (CPIM) (2004) RFC 3923 (Encryption) (2004)Introduced1999; 22 years ago (1999)IndustryInstant messaging Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP, originally named Jabber[1]) is an open communication protocol designed for instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance.[2] Based on XML (Extensible Markup Language), it enables the near-real-time exchange of structured data between any two or more network entities.[3] Designed to be extensible, the protocol offers a multitude of applications beyond traditional IM in the broader realm of message-oriented middleware, including signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming and other uses. Unlike most commercial instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard in the application layer. The architecture of the XMPP network is similar to email; anyone can run their own XMPP server and there is no central master server. This federated open system approach allows users to interoperate with others on any server using a 'JID' user account, similar to an email address. XMPP implementations can be developed using any software license and many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software. Numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist. Originally developed by the eponymous open-source community, the protocols were formalized as an approved instant messaging standard in 2004 and has been continuously developed with new extensions and features. Various XMPP client software are available on both desktop and mobile platforms and devices - by 2003 the protocol was used by over ten million people worldwide on the network, according to the XMPP Standards Foundation.[4] Internet protocol suite Application layer BGP DHCP DNS FTP HTTP HTTPS IMAP LDAP MGCP MQTT NNTP NTP POP PTP ONC/RPC RTP RTSP RIP SIP SMTP SNMP SSH Telnet TLS/SSL XMPP more...

Green clients are online, yellow clients are writing each other and small green subclients are the resources of one user. The brown network is not connected to the internet. The server draugr.de is connected to other IM services (ICQ, AIM and other) via XMPP transports. The XMPP network architecture is reminiscent of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), a client–server model; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server. By design, there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as AIM, WLM, WhatsApp or Telegram. Some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public XMPP server being run at jabber.org, to which many users subscribe. However, anyone may run their own XMPP server on their own domain. Addressing[edit] A standard JID Every user on the network has a unique XMPP address, called JID[5] (for historical reasons, XMPP addresses are often called Jabber IDs). The JID is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name (or IP address[6]) for the server where that user resides, separated by an at sign (@) - for example, “alice@example.com“: here alice is the username and example.com the server with which the user is registered. Since a user may wish to log in from multiple locations, they may specify a resource. A resource identifies a particular client belonging to the user (for example home, work, or mobile). This may be included in the JID by appending a slash followed by the name of the resource. For example, the full JID of a user's mobile account could be username@example.com/mobile. Each resource may have specified a numerical value called priority. Messages simply sent to username@example.com will go to the client with highest priority, but those sent to username@example.com/mobile will go only to the mobile client. The highest priority is the one with largest numerical value. JIDs without a username part are also valid, and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server. A resource remains optional for these JIDs as well. The means to route messages based on a logical endpoint identifier - the JID, instead of by an explicit IP Address present opportunities to use XMPP as an Overlay network implementation on top of different underlay networks. XMPP via HTTP[edit] The original and "native" transport protocol for XMPP is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), using open-ended XML streams over long-lived TCP connections. As an alternative to the TCP transport, the XMPP community has also developed an HTTP transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls. In the original specification, XMPP could use HTTP in two ways: polling[7] and binding. The polling method, now deprecated, essentially implies messages stored on a server-side database are being fetched (and posted) regularly by an XMPP client by way of HTTP 'GET' and 'POST' requests. The binding method, implemented using Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH),[8] allows servers to push messages to clients as soon as they are sent. This push model of notification is more efficient than polling, where many of the polls return no new data. Because the client uses HTTP, most firewalls allow clients to fetch and post messages without any hindrances. Thus, in scenarios where the TCP port used by XMPP is blocked, a server can listen on the normal HTTP port and the traffic should pass without problems. Various websites let people sign into XMPP via a browser. Furthermore, there are open public servers that listen on standard http (port 80) and https (port 443) ports, and hence allow connections from behind most firewalls. However, the IANA-registered port for BOSH is actually 5280, not 80. Extensibility[edit] The XMPP Standards Foundation or XSF (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions, so called XEP.[9] However, extensions can also be defined by any individual, software project, or organization. To maintain interoperability, common extensions are managed by the XSF. XMPP applications beyond IM include: chat rooms, network management, content syndication, collaboration tools, file sharing, gaming, remote systems control and monitoring, geolocation, middleware and cloud computing, VoIP, and identity services. Building on its capability to support discovery across local network domains, XMPP is well-suited for cloud computing where virtual machines, networks, and firewalls would otherwise present obstacles to alternative service discovery and presence-based solutions. Cloud computing and storage systems rely on various forms of communication over multiple levels, including not only messaging between systems to relay state but also the migration or distribution of larger objects, such as storage or virtual machines. Along with authentication and in-transit data protection, XMPP can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or Message-oriented middleware (MOM) protocol. Current limitations[edit] At the moment, XMPP does not support Quality of Service (QoS); assured delivery of messages has to be built on-top of the XMPP layer. There are two XEPs proposed to deal with this issue, XEP-0184 Message delivery receipts which is currently a draft standard, and XEP-0333 Chat Markers which is considered experimental. Since XML is text based, normal XMPP has a higher network overhead compared to purely binary solutions. This issue was being addressed by the experimental XEP-0322: Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format, where XML is serialized in a very efficient binary manner, especially in schema-informed mode. This XEP is currently deferred. In-band binary data transfer is limited. Binary data must be first base64 encoded before it can be transmitted in-band. Therefore, any significant amount of binary data (e.g., file transfers) is best transmitted out-of-band, using in-band messages to coordinate. The best example of this is the Jingle XMPP Extension Protocol, XEP-0166. Features[edit] File transfer options in a chat in Conversations, an XMPP client for Android Peer-to-peer sessions[edit] Using the extension called Jingle, XMPP can provide an open means to support machine-to-machine or peer-to-peer communications across a diverse set of networks. This feature is mainly used for IP telephony (VoIP). Multi-user chat[edit] XMPP supports conferences with multiple users, using the specification Multi-User Chat (MUC) (XEP-0045). From the point of view of a normal user, it is comparable to Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Security and encryption[edit] XMPP servers can be isolated (e.g., on a company intranet), and secure authentication (SASL) and point-to-point encryption (TLS) have been built into the core XMPP specifications, as well as Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) is an extension of XMPP enabling encryption of messages and data. It has since been replaced by a better extension, multi-end-to-multi-end encryption (OMEMO, XEP-0384) end-to-end encryption between users. This gives a higher level of security, by encrypting all data from the source client and decrypting again at the target client; the server operator cannot decrypt the data they are forwarding. Service discovery[edit] While several service discovery protocols exist today (such as zeroconf or the Service Location Protocol), XMPP provides a solid base for the discovery of services residing locally or across a network, and the availability of these services (via presence information), as specified by XEP-0030 DISCO.[10] Connecting to other protocols[edit] Alice sends a message through the XMPP net to the ICQ transport. The message is next routed to Bob via the ICQ network. One of the original design goals of the early Jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems (especially non-XMPP systems) through a single client application. This was done through entities called transports or gateways to other instant messaging protocols like ICQ, AIM or Yahoo Messenger, but also to protocols such as SMS, IRC or email. Unlike multi-protocol clients, XMPP provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running alongside an XMPP server. Any user can "register" with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network, and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were XMPP users. Thus, such gateways function as client proxies (the gateway authenticates on the user's behalf on the non-XMPP service). As a result, any client that fully supports XMPP can access any network with a gateway without extra code in the client, and without the need for the client to have direct access to the Internet. However, the client proxy model may violate terms of service on the protocol used (although such terms of service are not legally enforceable in several countries) and also requires the user to send their IM username and password to the third-party site that operates the transport (which may raise privacy and security concerns). Another type of gateway is a server-to-server gateway, which enables a non-XMPP server deployment to connect to native XMPP servers using the built in interdomain federation features of XMPP. Such server-to-server gateways are offered by several enterprise IM software products, including: IBM Lotus Sametime[11][12] Skype for Business Server (formerly named Microsoft Lync Server and Microsoft Office Communications Server – OCS)[13] Software[edit] XMPP is implemented by many clients, servers, and code libraries.[14] These implementations are provided under a variety of software licenses. Servers[edit] Main article: Comparison of XMPP server software Numerous XMPP server software exist, some well known ones include ejabberd and Prosody. Clients[edit] Buddy list and a multi-user chat in Spark A large number of XMPP client software exist on various modern and legacy platforms, including both graphical and command line based clients. According to the XMPP website, some of the most popular software include Gajim (Windows, Linux), Swift.IM (macOS, Windows, Linux), Conversations (Android), Monal (macOS, iOS) and Converse.js (Web Browser). Other clients include: Bombus, ChatSecure, Coccinella, JWChat.org, MCabber, Miranda, Pidgin, Psi, Tkabber, Trillian, and Xabber. Deployment and distribution[edit] There are thousands of XMPP servers worldwide, many public ones as well as private individuals or organizations running their own servers without commercial intent. Numerous websites show a list of public XMPP servers where users may register at (for example on the XMPP.net website). Several large public IM services natively use or used XMPP, including LiveJournal's "LJ Talk",[15] Nimbuzz, and HipChat. Various hosting services, such as DreamHost, enable hosting customers to choose XMPP services alongside more traditional web and email services. Specialized XMPP hosting services also exist in form of cloud so that domain owners need not directly run their own XMPP servers, including Cisco Webex Connect, Chrome.pl, Flosoft.biz, i-pobox.net, and hosted.im. XMPP is also used in deployments of non-IM services, including smart grid systems such as demand response applications, message-oriented middleware, and as a replacement for SMS to provide text messaging on many smartphone clients. Non-native deployments[edit] Some of the largest messaging providers use, or have been using, various forms of XMPP based protocols in their backend systems without necessarily exposing this fact to their end users.[16][17] One example is Google, which in August 2005 introduced Google Talk, a combination VoIP and IM system that uses XMPP for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called Jingle. The initial launch did not include server-to-server communications; Google enabled that feature on January 17, 2006.[18] Google has since added video functionality to Google Talk, also using the Jingle protocol for signaling. In May 2013, Google announced XMPP compatibility would be dropped from Google Talk for server-to-server federation, although it would retain client-to-server support.[19] In January 2008, AOL introduced experimental XMPP support for its AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) service,[20] allowing AIM users to communicate using XMPP. However, in March 2008, this service was discontinued.[citation needed] As of May 2011, AOL offers limited XMPP support.[21] In February 2010, the social-networking site Facebook opened up its chat feature to third-party applications via XMPP.[22] Some functionality was unavailable through XMPP, and support was dropped in April 2014.[23] Similarly, in December 2011, Microsoft released an XMPP interface to its Microsoft Messenger service.[24] Skype, its de facto successor, also provided limited XMPP support.[25] Apache Wave is another example.[26] XMPP is the de facto standard for private chat in gaming related platforms such as Origin,[27] and PlayStation, as well as the now discontinued Xfire and Raptr.[28] Two notable exceptions are Steam[29] and Xbox LIVE; both use their own proprietary messaging protocols. History and development[edit] Jabber logo Jeremie Miller began working on the Jabber technology in 1998 and released the first version of the jabberd server on January 4, 1999.[30] The early Jabber community focused on open-source software, mainly the jabberd server, but its major outcome proved to be the development of the XMPP protocol. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The early Jabber protocol, as developed in 1999 and 2000, formed the basis for XMPP as published in RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 in October 2004 (the primary changes during formalization by the IETF's XMPP Working Group were the addition of TLS for channel encryption and SASL for authentication). The XMPP Working group also produced specifications RFC 3922 and RFC 3923. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In 2015, RFC 6122 was superseded by RFC 7622. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions. The first IM service based on XMPP was Jabber.org, which has operated continuously and offered free accounts since 1999.[31] From 1999 until February 2006, the service used jabberd as its server software, at which time it migrated to ejabberd (both of which are free software application servers). In January 2010, the service migrated to the proprietary M-Link server software produced by Isode Ltd.[32] In September 2008, Cisco Systems acquired Jabber, Inc., the creators of the commercial product Jabber XCP.[33] The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) develops and publishes extensions to XMPP through a standards process centered on XMPP Extension Protocols (XEPs, previously known as Jabber Enhancement Proposals - JEPs). The following extensions are in especially wide use: Data Forms[34] Service Discovery[35] Multi-User Chat[36] Publish-Subscribe[37] and Personal Eventing Protocol[38] XHTML-IM[39] File Transfer[40] Entity Capabilities[41] HTTP Binding[8] Jingle for voice and video Internet of Things[edit] XMPP features such as federation across domains, publish/subscribe, authentication and its security even for mobile endpoints are being used to implement the Internet of Things. Several XMPP extensions are part of the experimental implementation: Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format;[42] Sensor Data;[43] Provisioning;[44] Control;[45] Concentrators;[46] Discovery.[47] These efforts are documented on a page in the XMPP wiki dedicated to Internet of Things[48] and the XMPP IoT mailing list.[49] Specifications and standards[edit] The IETF XMPP working group has produced a series of Request for Comments (RFC) documents: RFC 3920 (superseded by RFC 6120) RFC 3921 (superseded by RFC 6121) RFC 3922 RFC 3923 RFC 4622 (superseded by RFC 5122) RFC 4854 RFC 4979 RFC 6122 (superseded by RFC 7622) The most important and most widely implemented of these specifications are: RFC 6120, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core, which describes client–server messaging using two open-ended XML streams. XML streams consist of <presence/>, <message/> and <iq/> (info/query). A connection is authenticated with Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) and encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS). RFC 6121, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence describes instant messaging (IM), the most common application of XMPP. RFC 7622, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format describes the rules for XMPP addresses, also called JabberIDs or JIDs. Currently JIDs use PRECIS (as defined in RFC 7564) for handling of Unicode characters outside the ASCII range. Competing standards[edit] XMPP has often been regarded as a competitor to SIMPLE, based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as the standard protocol for instant messaging and presence notification.[50][51] The XMPP extension for multi-user chat[36] can be seen as a competitor to Internet Relay Chat (IRC), although IRC is far simpler, has far fewer features, and is far more widely used.[citation needed] The XMPP extensions for publish-subscribe[37] provide many of the same features as the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
