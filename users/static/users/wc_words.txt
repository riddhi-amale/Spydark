Lintian Tag: trailing-whitespace Lintian Reports Maintainers Tags Packages P trailing-whitespace This file contains lines with trailing whitespace characters. Whilst often harmless and unsightly, such extra whitespaces can also cause tools to interpret the whitespace characters literally. The tool diff(1) does not like them, either. They are best avoided. Some of these problems can be hard to track down. Whitespace at the end of lines may be removed with the following: $ sed -i -e 's@[[:space:]]&ast;$@@g' debian/control debian/changelog If you use Emacs, you can also use "M-x wh-cl" (whitespace-cleanup). However, if you wish to only remove trailing spaces and leave trailing tabs (eg. for Makefiles), you can use the following code snippet: $ sed -i -e 's@[ ]&ast;$@@g' debian/rules To remove empty lines from the end of a file, you can use: $ sed -i -e :a -e '/^\n&ast;$/{$d;N;};/\n$/ba' debian/rules Visibility: pedantic Check: debian/trailing-whitespace These source packages in the archive trigger the

It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its source code was released as open-source software. 1 Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin. Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, its high electricity consumption, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists, including several Nobel laureates, have characterized it as a speculative bubble. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.

Scam List of Tor TOR SCAM LIST VERIFIED SITES Report false listing Add new scam SCAM LINKS LIST Home Trusted links When I created this site, I didn't want to add "good" list. I only wanted to warn you against dishonest sellers. Unfortunately reality changed that because 70% mails I got was with requests about real sites. On beginning I was sick of losing money, now I'm tired of answering those mails... So I want to see if that's gonna help you choose well. Personally I'm sure that those sites are legit but I need to warn you anyway - not always you're gonna get your thing on time and not always it's gonna be 100% as promised. But the most important - you don't lose your money. Colorado Cannabis - http://cc365rfnwxcmeizmlxo2unibbodwqykjrxvaawjj6ofs5clondovalid.onion/ - Colorado Cannabis offers a strong range of Marijuana products. Buy Marijuana at their online shop with Fast and Safe Worldwide Shipping. Light Money - http://lmoney3jlirnqvcnxv6msy5ol6qyjwisfvk63v3grvkt7hzyyh5tjsad.onion/ - this site is the Most Reliable and Fastest Store of Prepaid Cards, PayPal and WU Transfers, as well as Gift Cards. Plastic Market - http://plastic4xuqjt52uwbmxsbyrwor3garq4t5kvpes4i6hfmfyufkf54qd.onion/ - thanks to this contact you can "easy" buy Counterfeit Banknotes from Peru | Cloned Credit Cards from USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Europe | Paypal Accounts from USA and Europe | Bank Accounts from USA and Europe. Keep in mind - delievery time is longer than on site. Buy Real Money - http://buyreal4ka5ulaeatencombd52pnihjmnjfubtad4ze4dixp76ovrrid.onion/ - when you buy from this seller you can be sure about your cyber-security because you buy here real cash (no way to follow what you do with this). The most secure option but the most expensive one. Apple Store - http://apple2dcve46str6ogmf4sqzppqgjwrqaadcljz3lq6n3egim33zqpid.onion/ - first shop on my list where you can buy electronics and be sure that it's not gonna be blocked for your country and won't be a fake replica. It's normal Apple store with legit products, invidual serial numbers and original 12-months guarantee. No tax paid by seller so products are much cheaper.

Carefully Choose Your Darknet Market There are so many dark web markets available on the TOR network that it becomes pretty difficult for one to choose which is best for him. However, it would be best if you research in-depth about the markets you are about to buy drugs from. Either way, you can go through the intended vendor shops and check the reviews and ratings left by the users to get a fair knowledge of where you are putting your money in. Another thing that you must check out about the dark net markets is that if there is any chance of the market getting down or causing an exit scam. Visit the darknet forums to get some ideas. We are Legit Dark Web Pharmacy Apart from some of the dark web pharmacies, the internet is filled up with fake pharmacies offering illegal drug sales. Often, many of these pharmacies are not located in the United States and thus they are not subjected to American governance. The teenagers can go to any online deep web markets and order illegal drugs of any quantity from the prescription medicines in discreet packaging. Purchasing the so-called prescription drugs could either mean the teens are purchasing sugar pills or highly toxic and deadly substances. Overdose of these drugs is often possible as they do not come with proper prescribed dosage or quality control.

Services can go down temporarily, so we keep track of when they do and maintain a list of dead hidden services. In addition to an onion simply being gone (Tor cannot resolve the onion), sites that display 404 (and use a known onion/URL based hosting service) are the only other thing that is considered truly DOWN. Presumably the account is gone. If a service has been down for a while, tag it with ' - DOWN YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went down). If a tagged service on the above list of live hidden services has come back up, remove the DOWN tag. If a tagged service is still down after a month, please move it (along with the DOWN tag) to the list of dead hidden services. The general idea of the remaining four service states below is that, if the Hidden Service Descriptor is available, and something is responding behind it... the service is considered up, and we track that fact on the Main Page. If any of these subsequently go offline, append the DOWN tag and handle as above. Hello world's / statements, minimal sites, services with low user activity, etc (while boring)... are listed as usual. Broken services are those that display 404 (and do not use a known hosting service), PHP or other errors (or they fail silently)... any of which prevent the use of the service as intended. They also include blank pages, empty dirs and neglected status notes. Presumably the operator is in limbo. Broken services are tagged with ' (reason) - Broken YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went broken) Services that automatically redirect to another service (such as by HTTP protocol or script), have their redirection destinations noted in their descriptions. These are tagged with ' - Redir YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went redir) Sites that are formally closed via announcement are tagged with ' - Closed YYYY-MM-DD' (your guess as to when it went closed. Is Online that HiddenService? This service is very useful in determining whether onions are up or not. It also gives a reason why they are down. Sites on this list that have no chance of coming back (LE takedowns, dead for some time) should be archived to page dead services just in case they should ever be needed.

Coffee Brewing Strategies - Obtaining the best Espresso Maker To your Espresso Tastes along with your Way of life - The Hidden Wiki Coffee Brewing Strategies - Obtaining the best Espresso Maker To your Espresso Tastes along with your Way of lifeFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to searchThere may be an impediment program associated with brewing an incredible cup of espresso. Whenever you ﻿ground coffee awaken for do the job at six:00 AM and you have 30-45 minutes to hit the highway, how are you currently going to acquire a excellent, incredibly hot cup of brew with your hand once you do? The chances are, you could possibly be brewing inside a way that delivers flavor considerably superior to everything you are acquiring now, as well as in the identical amount of money of time, or maybe significantly less.To help you you decide what brewing strategy, or strategies, will best match your needs, commence by inquiring these queries:1) What are the occasions does one normally drink coffee, and what is the relative worth of taste and usefulness?two) The amount income have you been willing to commit on espresso, a coffee maker, or numerous brewing tools?3)Can this individual brewing equipment deliver good espresso?For some coffee enthusiasts, the largest hurdle to beat when you start off to receive seriously interested in espresso may be the fact that you personal an electric drip coffeemaker, and also the vast majority from the electric powered drip brewers sacrifice several of the style for convenience. If great style is your greatest goal, you might want to think of an expense of time rather than pounds. Grinding refreshing espresso beans, and measuring coffee specifically, will turn out to be next mother nature immediately after about a 7 days. In case you will likely be visiting the hassle of shopping for contemporary, perfectly-roasted espresso beans, then you definately really should brew coffee to obtain each cherished little bit of flavor and aroma you're purchasing.An incredible drip maker brings together the crucial brewing factors in a precise way. You need a filter that contains a significant total of fresh grounds for each six ounces of espresso brewing. The drinking water must be heated to 195-205 degrees F. The h2o needs to be allowed to saturate the grounds carefully and completely. The full brew cycle, from start out to finish, have to take from 4 to six minutes. If it takes extended than 8 minutes, the espresso will probably be over-extracted and bitter.It can be virtually unachievable to brew drip coffee that meets the above conditions applying your normal home electric powered brewer. This is certainly what prospects for the annoyance so many coffee enthusiasts appear throughout if they endeavor to copy great coffee-bar coffee at home. Brewing manually, in which you can regulate the brewing course of action, remains the absolute most effective way to get a terrific cup of espresso. Because almost no espresso maker underneath $150 can make fantastic espresso, you will must sacrifice some taste when utilizing just one. Invest some money on the espresso maker that will get the ideal reviews, no matter of rate, often use high quality espresso, and you may appear closest to your greatest cup of coffee attainable within an computerized coffee maker..

Siterules - The Hidden Wiki SiterulesFrom The Hidden WikiJump to navigationJump to searchRules of the Hidden Wiki The Hidden Wiki is basically a big (the biggest?) directory of working websites, it serves as a directory of links to other .onion sites. To maintain some order here, a few simple rules must be followed. On the Main Page: No vandalizing of links (For example: changing the URLs by one letter) No phishing (For example: changing the legit URLs to some phishing URL) No deleting of working links (except if they are down for a longer period of time.) Only TOR sites (ending with .onion) are allowed. Changing URLs to clearnet ones (to 'onion.to', or to 'tor2web' for example) will be treated as vandalism. The Main Page is a big, neutral .onion directory. Let's keep it that way: If you have opinions about a site, use the Talk pages for that. Financial/Commercial services: The "Financial" and "Commercial" sections are special sections here, because there is a healthy competition going on between the vendors. That is why these sections have the most revisions and changes. The site would like to offer every vendor an equally fair chance, so there are some special rules for these two sections, to provide these equal chances. Because the HW is still a directory of links, and is not someone's personal advertising platform, the following rules apply: In the Financial/Commercial sections: No bold text, no fancy wrappers. Every link must look the same for a visitor. No hosting of commercial/financial services on the Hidden Wiki. If you have something to sell, then rent/create a host, like others do. The Hidden Wiki is not a hosting provider. A single image does not qualify as a website. Since the HW is a directory of websites, linking to a single image is not allowed. Just like above: use a webserver, set up a website, like the others do. Vendors are competing for 'spots'. If you're a new user with a new site, please don't trigger an edit war: respect the vendors who were here before, and do not put a new link on the top of the already established list. These rules are not very strict, and are easy to follow. Anyone who strikingly disobeys them is risking his username here. Other notes: Please note that almost anyone can edit the regular pages, there is minimal protection on them.(That means, if you write something somewhere, nobody guarantees that it will be there tomorrow. This is the nature of the Hidden Wiki: information that others find useless may perish. The solution: write only things that the community can benefit from. You can earn some respect that way.) Rules last updated: 28 May 2014 SITE DISCLAIMER This hidden website (The "Hidden Wiki") is a community editable directory, and information source. The site holds no responsibility for the content uploaded by it's users, for the validity of the information presented here, or for the content of external sites. The administrator(s) of the site does not have the capacity to check and/or validate every link and every information uploaded here. Every uploader holds full responsibility for the content he/she uploads. The Hidden Wiki does not verify or mark services in any way. Please bear in mind that anybody can contribute to the Wiki, so just because something is written here, it doesn't necessarily mean it's true. While in general, we're asking our users to not link to websites with illegal content on them, this term is relative to the country where the linked website resides in. We cannot check that either. So, it is possible that some of the links you find here can take you to places you'll find inappropriate. It is your responsibility to do your research before using any information here. Legality: This website is a community editable public directory, basically a big bunch of links to working .Onion sites. There is no illegal content hosted on our servers. If you find one however, please leave a message about it on the admin's talk page. The Hidden Wiki is a 100% free service. It does not, and will not accept payments of any kind. No exceptions. If anyone asks for money (or coins) for their services regarding the Hidden Wiki, it is very likely that he is a scammer, and you will pay for an otherwise free service (or worse: you'll pay for nothing). Pay at your own discretion.

We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash: - Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scales This is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors. The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin). You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building. However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate. - 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scales It depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger. For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles. - larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, synthetics That's true .. including bread crumbs ..... ğŸ™‚ - skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed. ..... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming. It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours. - skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc. Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales. However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites. Information on dust particle size Â©ISO.

Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsear...âSpecial thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scalesThis is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scalesIt depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, syntheticsThat's true .. including bread crumbs ..... ð- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed...... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.Information on dust particle size Â©ISO.

We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scalesThis is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scalesIt depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, syntheticsThat's true .. including bread crumbs ..... ð- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed...... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.Information on dust particle size Â©ISO.

Purchase Cottonelle Flushable Wipes and try them for yourself: https://bit.ly/2WJm9HqâSpecial thanks to:Prof. Beverley McKeon and team https://www.mckeon.caltech.eduâDestin from Smarter Every Day https://www.youtube.com/smartereverydayâNicole Sharp from FYFD https://ve42.co/fyfdâPavol Dobryakov turbulent simulations: https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-...âI got into turbulent flow via chaos. The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von KÃ rmÃ n vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.Animations by:Jonny Hyman (Sun, Jupiter, Reynolds, airfoil, Earth time-lapse)Research and writing:AJ Fillo and Derek Muller.

The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von KÃ rmÃ n vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.Animations by:Jonny Hyman (Sun, Jupiter, Reynolds, airfoil, Earth time-lapse)Research and writing:AJ Fillo and Derek Muller.

We can use the SchrÃ¶dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and SchrÃ¶dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by IvÃ¡n TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.comâ "Experimental 1" "Serene Story 2" "Seaweed" "Colorful Animation 4" Hi!

Thanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLPâWhat causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.Special thanks to:Professor David Sinclair, check out his book "Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To"Assistant Professor David GoldNoemie Sierra (for polyp images)Genepool Productions for telomere animations from Immortal: https://ve42.co/immortalâEpigenetics animations (DNA, histones, methylation etc) courtesy of: http://wehi.tvâAnimation: Etsuko UnoArt and Technical Direction: Drew BerrySound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma BortignonScientific Consultation: Marnie BlewittCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical ResearchFilming, editing and animation by Jonny Hyman and Derek MullerMusic from https://epidemicsound.comâ "Clearer Views" "Innovations" "A Sound Foundation" "Seaweed"Additional music by Kevin MacLeod from https://incompetech.comâ "Marty Gots a Plan" Hi!

I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.Music from https://epidemicsound.comâ "The Longest Rest" "A Sound Foundation" "Seaweed" Hi!

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change. Hi! Looks like you have JavaScript turned off.

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change. Hi! Looks like you have JavaScript turned off.

For this video I partnered with Starbucks to celebrate their Nitro Cold Brew. Order one here: https://starbucks.app.link/derekmullerâMaking liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.Borrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the âpermanentâ gases.A French Physicist AimÃ© compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didnât liquefy.Only at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.It's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature. Hi! Looks like you have JavaScript turned off.

For this video I partnered with Starbucks to celebrate their Nitro Cold Brew. Order one here: https://starbucks.app.link/derekmullerâMaking liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.Borrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the âpermanentâ gases.A French Physicist AimÃ© compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didnât liquefy.Only at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.It's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature. Hi! Looks like you have JavaScript turned off.

I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover.How do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:Have large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).Plus the aircraft has to be light:The Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!One of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:Temperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.The craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible.

Start listening with a 30-day trial and your first audiobook plus two Audible Originals free when you go to http://audible.com/veritasiumâ or text veritasium to 500500I found this story fascinating because in a way a nuclear bomb crater is more like a meteorite impact site than an impact site itself. Consider: Barringer Crater was claimed to be a meteorite impact site but geologists dismissed it as a volcanic formation. It was only after studying nuclear bomb craters and the minerals found there that geologists concluded the energy and pressures that created Barringer Crater were too high to be from volcanic activity and therefore must have formed from a meteorite impact.Special Thanks to:Nevada National Security SiteThe National Atomic Testing MuseumJonny Hyman and Verse: https://youtu.be/7bUUGzi-AAYâActive Galactic for footage of craters in Arizona: https://youtu.be/yhoooBpndogâSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:a human, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Daniel Milum, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, Illya Nayshevsky, James Knight, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Listen Money Matters, Lyvann Ferrusca, Manuel ZÃ¼rcher, Mathias GÃ¶ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, OddJosh, Philipp Volgger, Pindex, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252Filmed by Raquel NunoStory and Editing by Derek Muller and Jonny HymanMusic and Animation by Jonny HymanProduced by Casey Rentz Hi!

This video looks at modifying aerogels to take advantage of their unique characteristics.Subscribe to Veritasium: https://ve42.co/subâHuge thanks to Dr. Stephen Steiner and the crew at Aerogel Technologies. To find out more or buy your own aerogel sample, check out: http://www.aerogeltechnologies.com/âThanks to Dr. Steven Jones and Dr. Mihail Petkov at NASA's Jet Propulsion LaboratoryAnd thanks to FLIR for loaning us the awesome high definition thermal camera. The footage is amazing! https://www.flir.comâAerogelâs extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by âdrying out insectsâ reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.Special thanks to all my Patreon supporters especially those who contributed feedback to an earlier draft of this video:a human, Albert Jachowicz-BrzeziÅski, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel ZÃ¼rcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias GÃ¶ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick Äalija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252Filmed by Paul GramagliaThumbnail by Ignat BerbeciAnimations by Catherine ChooljianMusic from https://epidemicsound.comâ âTonic Zoneâ âBetelgeuseâ âInsidious Miceâ âSeaweedâ âItâs not that seriousâ âPlatin00m - Sum ItâThis is an educational, scientific video.

This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them.

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content.

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.comâ "Colorful Animation 4" "Seaweed"And from Kevin MacLeod "Marty Gots a Plan"This is an educational video about the science of water quality.

Can you guess which student won $250,000 in the #RegeneronSTSâ? Applications open June 1: http://bit.ly/2HkLXT1â This video was sponsored by Regeneron. The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.Huge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno Hi!

Can you guess which student won $250,000 in the #RegeneronSTSâ? Applications open June 1: http://bit.ly/2HkLXT1â This video was sponsored by Regeneron. The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.Huge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno Hi!

But what is that image really showing us?This is an awesome paper on the topic by J.P. Luminet:Image of a spherical black hole with thin accretion diskAstronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 75, no. 1-2, May 1979, p. 228-235https://ve42.co/luminetâUsing my every day intuition I wondered: will we see the "shadow" of the black hole even if we're looking edge on at the accretion disk? The answer is yes because the black hole warps space-time, so even if we wouldn't normally be able to see the back of the accretion disk, we can in this case because its light is bent up and over the black hole. Similarly we can see light from the bottom of the back of the accretion disk because it's bent under the bottom of the black hole. Plus there are additional images from light that does a half turn around the black hole leading to the inner rings.What about the black hole "shadow" itself? Well initially I thought it can't be an image of the event horizon because it's so much bigger (2.6 times bigger). But if you trace back the rays, you find that for every point in the shadow, there is a corresponding ray that traces back to the event horizon. So in fact from our one observing location, we see all sides of the event horizon simultaneously! In fact infinitely many of these images, accounting for the virtually infinite number of times a photon can orbit the black hole before falling in. The edge of the shadow is due to the photon sphere - the radius at which light goes around in closed orbits. If a light ray coming in at an oblique angle just skims the photon sphere and then travels on to our telescopes, that is the closest 'impact parameter' possible, and it occurs at sqrt(27)/2*r_sHuge thanks to:Prof. Geraint Lewis University of Sydney https://ve42.co/gflâLike him, I'm hoping (predicting?) we'll see some moving images of black holes tomorrowProf. Rana AdhikariCaltech https://ve42.co/RanaâRiccardo Antonelli - for excellent images of black holes, simulations and ray-tracing code, check out:https://ve42.co/rantonelsâThe Event Horizon Telescope CollaborationCheck out their resources and get your local link for the livestream here: https://ve42.co/EHTâSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward RhymeFilming by Raquel NunoAnimation by Maria Raykova Hi!

I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.Additional resources and references:The Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Mediumhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftapeâWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.Sound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.Something I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...Animations by Alan ChamberlainMusic from http://epidemicsound.comâ "Seaweed" Hi! Looks like you have JavaScript turned off.

So far we understand little - just that certain regions of the brain appear to be involved in certain activities and certain disorders. In extreme cases this has led to the practice of removing sections of the brain, or using electrodes or optical fibers to control activation rates. What is unique about this approach is it offers a way to turn on and off specific brain regions without invasive surgery. It has promise because it combines existing technologies: micro-bubbles, ultrasound, synthetic viruses, and synthetic drugs to achieve this goal.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, James M Nicholson, Michael Krugman, Nathan Hansen, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance ShepherdAnimations and editing by Alan ChamberlainMusic from http://epidemicsound.comâ "Experimental1" Hi!

When we can more accurately and routinely measure a kilogram, a mole, a kelvin and an ampere, then we can make better observations, we can better detect anomalies and improve our theories.

Do you know how hard it is when you are thrust into low-gravity, like the 37% of Earth's gravity of Mars, and you have to remember what you were going to say in a 30 second window as blood floods your head? It's pretty hard. It would be even harder to actually travel to Mars. It would take about 8 months in microgravity during which time your muscles and bones would weaken substantially, even if you exercise for hours a day like the astronauts on the space station. And your heart is a muscle too so it weakens as well. Before I contemplated these rates of muscle and bone loss, I thought the major challenge with a round trip journey to Mars would be the logistics of spacecraft and having enough fuel to get back. But with the weakening of the human body, it's an open question whether anyone would really want to come back.Filmed by Steve BoxallMusic from Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.comâ Hi!

This is something I learned filming with the UV camera inside.Special thanks to Dr. Hayley Golbach, @hayleysgold on twitterhttps://twitter.com/hayleysgoldâUltraviolet light causes damage to DNA, leads to cancer and photoaging: age spots and wrinkles. I was curious about this because UV is technically non-ionizing. A photon of UV doesn't have enough energy to strip an electron off atoms or molecules. However it does have enough energy to trigger photo-chemical reactions. For example, it causes pyrimidine dimers - the unauthorized covalent bonding of adjacent thymine or cytosine bases in our DNA. If these spots are not properly repaired, they may lead to mutations and cancer. Photoaging is typically the result of degradation of collagen and elastin fibers - scaffolding that supports the skin. This leads to wrinkles and saggy-looking skin.Huge thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Yildiz Kabaran, Terrance Snow, Stan Presolski, James M Nicholson, KIMoFySupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreonâMusic from Epidemic Sound http://epidemicsound.comâ "Serene Story 2" Hi!

Is it because of soil depletion, selective breeding, or... something else?Watch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vitaâI came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.Thanks to Kate Pappas & Chris Kamen for writing, producing and filming this video with meEdited by Lucy McCallumSound mix by Wayne HyettFact Checking by Calvin Lee and Claire Smith Thanks to the Collingwood Childrenâs Farm and Glenn Fitzgerald from the University of Melbourne & Agriculture VictoriaFurther Reading: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science...âhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1...âhttp://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/...âhttps://www.politico.com/agenda/story...âhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-24...â Hi!

Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.Special thanks to HHMI BioInteractive for their awesome animations of melanocytes and how the melanin in melanosomes protect your DNA.

If you have less you can setup SWAP to have a combined amount of 2 GB or use Docker instead. After installation take a look at the Post-install steps. Automated installation: Invidious-Updater is a self-contained script that can automatically install and update Invidious. Docker: Build and start cluster: $ docker-compose up Then visit localhost:3000 in your browser.
